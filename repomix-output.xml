# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

##  Overview
Sententia is a MERN stack blogging platform that combines a Pinterest-inspired masonry layout with a traditional blogging experience. It allows users to manage their profiles (change username, blog name, avatar, and cover image), create and delete posts, and enjoy an infinite-scroll feed. The client uses React (with Vite, TailwindCSS, React Query, and Clerk authentication), while the server is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, featuring secure authentication via Clerk Webhook and media uploads via ImageKit.
